            HI! My name is Boujrada yassine, I have a passion for creating websites and developing 
            Machine Learning models that enhance the lives of others. My interest in development was 
            sparked in 2020 when I see how sometimes can just a language save or change lives of people.
          </p>
          <p className="about-grid-info-text">
            So After graduating with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science ,and another degree in 
            Data Science and Business Intelligence üë®‚Äçüéìüéì. I embarked on a journey to follow my programming passion. 
            By challenging myself to create a lot of projects, I delved into the realm of full-stack web development 
            and machine learning field, in the other hand, I participated in national coding competitions. 
            Among all the facets of programming, I find the problem-solving element to be the most exhilarating. 
            The sensation of unraveling a complex challenge and unveiling a solution is truly gratifying this 
            sentiment if I can say that all programmers love it.
          </p>
          <p className="about-grid-info-text">
            Additionally, I share my knowledge and passion with the world
            through my YouTube channel, where I demonstrate how to build
            full-stack applications.

            Beyond coding, my interests, playing video games, watching movies and sometimes reading books .
            I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning new language.
