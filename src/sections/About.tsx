            HI! My name is Boujrada yassine, I have a passion for creating websites and developing 
            Machine Learning models that enhance the lives of others.

            So After graduating with a bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Science ,and another degree in Data Science and Business Intelligence üë®‚Äçüéìüéì.
            I set out on a journey to pursue my programming passion. I ventured into the realms of full-stack web development and machine learning
             by challenging myself to create a large number of projects, while also competing in national coding competitions. Among all aspects 
             of programming, I find problem-solving to be the most exciting. The sense of unraveling a complex problem and revealing a solution 
             is really pleasant, and I believe that all programmers share this sentiment.
